# Git & GitHub Practice Repository

This repository contains my **hands-on practice with Git and GitHub**, focused on commands and workflows commonly used in **DevOps environments**.

## What I Practiced

* Initializing and configuring Git repositories
* Staging, committing, and writing meaningful commit messages
* Working with branches using feature-based workflows
* Pushing and synchronizing changes with GitHub
* Practicing real-world Git scenarios, including:

  * Stashing work in progress
  * Cherry-picking specific commits
  * Merging branches and resolving merge conflicts
  * Using `git reset` (soft, mixed, hard) correctly
  * Understanding `rebase` vs `merge` and when to use each

## Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to build **practical Git experience**, not just command-level knowledge.
All commands were practiced with real use cases similar to daily **DevOps workflows**, such as feature development, hotfixes, clean history management, and safe production changes.

## Environment

* **OS:** Ubuntu (Linux)
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Bash Terminal

## Notes

This repository is for **learning and demonstration purposes** and reflects my step-by-step progress in mastering Git and GitHub fundamentals used in DevOps.
